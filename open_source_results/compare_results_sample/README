Please get a day's worth of processing results at the following link.

Due to ethical considerations and to avoid disclosing operations that may have security risks, 
1) we only made one day's results here and only sampled the results of the first 5,050 domains; 
2) we anonymised IP addresses for non-special purposes; 
and 3) we filtered out the results of the vulnerable PDNS resolvers and did not make them public.
